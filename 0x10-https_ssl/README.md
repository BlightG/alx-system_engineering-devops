## Learning Objectives

At the end of the-is project, you are expected to be able to [explain to anyone](https://fs.blog/feynman-learning-technique/), **without the help of Google:**

- What is HTTPS SSL 2 main roles
- What is the purpose encrypting traffic
- What SSL termination means

## Requirements

### General

- Allowed editors: **vi**, **vim**, **emacs**
- All your files will be interpreted on Ubuntu 16.04 LTS
- All your files should end with a new line
- A **README.md** file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
- All your Bash script files must be executable
- Your Bash script must pass **Shellcheck** (version **0.3.7**) without any error
- The first line of all your Bash scripts should be exactly **#!/usr/bin/env bash**
- The second line of all your Bash scripts should be a comment explaining what is the script doing

## Tasks

### - [ ] 0. World wide web

Configure your domain zone so that the subdomain www points to your load-balancer IP (lb-01). Letâ€™s also add other subdomains to make our life easier, and write a Bash script that will display information about subdomains.

Requirements:

- Add the subdomain www to your domain, point it to your lb-01 IP (your domain name might be configured with default subdomains, feel free to remove them)
- Add the subdomain lb-01 to your domain, point it to your lb-01 IP
- Add the subdomain web-01 to your domain, point it to your web-01 IP
- Add the subdomain web-02 to your domain, point it to your web-02 IP
- Your Bash script must accept 2 arguments:
	1. domain:
	    - type: string
		- what: domain name to audit
		- mandatory: yes
	1. subdomain:
		- type: string
	    - what: specific subdomain to audit
		- mandatory: no
- Output: `The subdomain [SUB_DOMAIN] is a [RECORD_TYPE] record and points to [DESTINATION]`
- When only the parameter **domain** is provided, display information for its subdomains **www**, **lb-01**, **web-01** and **web-02** - in this specific order
- When passing **domain** and **subdomain** parameters, display information for the specified subdomain
- Ignore **shellcheck** case **SC2086**
- Must use:
	- **awk**
	- at least one Bash function
- You do not need to handle edge cases such as:
	- Empty parameters
	- Nonexistent domain names
	- Nonexistent subdomains
